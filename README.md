Our cyclone prediction system is a sophisticated framework designed to forecast the formation, track, and intensity of cyclones, which are powerful and destructive storm systems. It sends a warning message to the user stuck in the cyclone and pinpoints the exact location of the person. 

To execute the program files:
1.	Execute the main.py file on your computer. With changes in the phone number part of the program. This line is highlighted with a comment to change the phone number to get the warning message on your device(line:154). You can change the location of the area you wish to track by editing the city part of the code(line:14) 
2.	First you must run the server.py file and then open the location web page attached in the zip, to extract latitude and longitude of your location. 
3.	Then run the map2.py file to get a pop-up map with the pinpoint location and the range of the disaster site.
